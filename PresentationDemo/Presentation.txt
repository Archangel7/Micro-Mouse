listings and other items as necessary. The folders that are expected in the repository include:
• BuildInstructions
• Database
• Application
• Algorithms
• PresentDemo
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS Grade: ____/5
The BuildInstructions folder should contain content based on the website established for the
hardware build. It should enable a technology student to recreate the project. An example:
https://learn.adafruit.com/minty-boost/process
As such it should contain the computer systems project in block diagramme form and project activities
such as ideas, references, parts information/bill of materials/budget/work breakdown/cost estimate,
problems, as well as test data.
SYSTEM SOFTWARE Grade: ____/10
The Database, Application, and Algorithms folders contain work lead by specific team members and
referenced by the build instructions. The repository should be used in developing the source code for
your project. Thus, it should contain the latest version of the software that your project uses. The
code that you use should be well commented and include details of the essential
parameters/configuration files. Each team member will be marked individually on the work contained
within the folder that they were responsible for leading. Each folder is to include the respective
portions of the build instruction content and 3 minutes of the presentation material.
MATERIALS FOR PRESENTATION AND DEMONSTRATION Grade: ____/5
In the PresentDemo folder include:
• PowerPoint or alternate presentation slides.
• 30 second Hardware Build video, 30 second Computer System Project pitch video.
• A 5x7” Placard in Microsoft Publisher format that includes the project title, team member names,
highlighted specifications/functions, and a photo of the actual project for printing on foam core to
support the Demonstration. When named ProjectName_DRAFT.pub it will not be printed, if named
