# Micro-Mouse

The AVR Micro-Mouse Project was constructed for the Humber Computer Engineering Computer Systems Project. 

This repository is based upon the Project Documentation Rubric.

It has the code for the Micro-Mouse and the Android Application as well as the Database. It also includes links to our build 
websites, presentation slides and other items such as the budget and gantt chart.
